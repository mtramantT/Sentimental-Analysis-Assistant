    <h2>Databinding</h2>
    <p>
        In angular, databinding is the act of passing data from the back
        to the front or vice versa. note that the "view" is the part of
        the component that actually displays information to the user
        <br>
        There are 3 ways to perform one-way databinding. These are
        techniques where either the data is passed from the front to
        the back or the back to the front
    </p>

    <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
    <p>
        In order to perform interpolation, you need to write the item
        to be evaluated in between double curly braces:
        {{<b>expression</b>}}. It is essentially a block of typescript as
        innerHTML.
    </p>

    <p><b>Examples</b></p>
    <br>2 + 5 * 3 - 1 * 88 = {{2 + 5 * 3 - 1 * 88}}
    <br>The Secret Message is.....{{variable}}

    <h3>Property Binding</h3>
    <p>
        Property binding is a "one-way binding" technique that binds
        from the back to the front. We do this by surrounding what would
        be the attribute of the elemnt with square brackets
        [like this]
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-danger" (click)="toggleVisibility()">
        Toggle
    </button>
    <div [hidden]="visibility">
        <p>Here I am!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Event Binding</h3>
    <p>
        Event binding is the third type of one-way binding. It is done
        within the element's tag, agian like property binding, except
        we put it within paranthesis (). We will typically end up wrapping
        these around actual events as well. Ex: (click)
    </p>

    <h3>Two-Way databinding</h3>
    <p>
        We can set up two way databinding, where data we input is
        fed back to a component and can be brought back all in
        the same action. In order to do this, we invoke both property
        and event binding. EX: [(ngModel)]
    </p>
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="userInput">
    <p>
        Your input is: {{userInput}}
    </p>
</div>
